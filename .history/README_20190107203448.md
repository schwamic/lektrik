# LEKTRIK
An interactive lightbulb installation for the club HALLO WERNER in Augsburg.

The installation was developed as part of the Interactive Media course at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences and in collaboration with the design agency YEAH. The aim of the project was to develop a music visualization tool for the existing light installation. The music is analyzed live by software and an animation is calculated to match the piece of music. Using a MIDI controller, any type of animation can be triggered and changed. 

Technology: 210 light bulbs, 30 relays, VVVV, MidiController, Python, OSC.
